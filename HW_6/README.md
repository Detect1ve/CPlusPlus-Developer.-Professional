# 6. Matrix

Implement an infinite sparse matrix using the Proxy pattern.

Design a 2-dimensional sparse infinite matrix filled with default values. The matrix should store only occupied elements - those whose values â€‹â€‹have been assigned at least once. Assigning a default value to a cell frees the cell.

ðŸ’¡ It is necessary to be able to answer the question - how many cells are occupied?

ðŸ’¡ It is necessary to be able to iterate over all occupied cells. The order does not matter. The position of the cell and its value are returned.

ðŸ’¡ When reading an element from a free cell, return the default value.

**Example:**
```cpp
// infinite matrix int filled with values â€‹â€‹-1
Matrix<int, -1> matrix;
assert(matrix.size() == 0); // all cells are free
auto a = matrix[0][0];
assert(a == -1);
assert(matrix.size() == 0);
matrix[100][100] = 314;
assert(matrix[100][100] == 314);
assert(matrix.size() == 1);
// one row will be printed
// 100100314
for(auto c: matrix)
{
	int x;
	int y;
	int v;
	std::tie(x, y, v) = c;
	std::cout << x << y << v << std::endl;
}
```
1. When starting the program, it is necessary to create a matrix with an empty value 0, fill the main diagonal of the matrix (from \[0,0\] to \[9,9\]) with values â€‹â€‹from 0 to 9.
2. The secondary diagonal (from \[0,9\] to \[9,0\]) with values â€‹â€‹from 9 to 0.
3. It is necessary to output a fragment of the matrix from \[1,1\] to \[8,8\]. Space between columns. Each row of the matrix is on a new line of the console.
4. Output the number of occupied cells.
5. Output all occupied cells along with their positions.
6. Optionally implement an N-dimensional matrix.
7. Optionally implement the canonical form of the `=` operator, allowing expressions `((matrix[100][100] = 314) = 0) = 217`

### Self-control
- indexing with the `[]` operator
- the number of occupied cells should be 18 after running the example above

### Verification
The task is considered successful if, after analyzing the code, installing the package, and running the application, a fragment of the matrix, the number of cells, and a list of all values with their corresponding positions appear.
